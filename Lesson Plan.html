    <p class="lessons">Lessons are typically thirty minutes long once a week, but I can work with your schedule to set up what works best. I can do lessons at my home or at the student's. During the first few levels, students will play games with flash cards for the the first fifteen minutes of class. After that they work either in the book or on a larger song. The books we use are Alfred's Premier Piano Course Performance, Theory, and Lesson of the proper level. You can buy a good pack on Amazon <a class="amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/Premier-Piano-Course-Success-Kit/dp/0739037765/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=83DZHDANZVB5R7H9JH3F">here</a>.</p>

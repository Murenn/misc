    <p class="hi">Hi! My name's Elise Riddle. I'm sixteen years old, and I've been teaching piano for a little more than a year. I started learning how to play the clarinet when I was nine, and moved to piano about three years ago. It's my goal to help kids grow into great musicians and learn to love music in a fun and relaxed enviornment. I work with beginners ages first grade through middle school, but I will take younger children if they have prior experience.</p>
